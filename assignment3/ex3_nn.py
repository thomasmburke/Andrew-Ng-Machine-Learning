%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 3 | Part 2: Neural Networks

%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     lrCostFunction.m (logistic regression cost function)
%     oneVsAll.m
%     predictOneVsAll.m
%     predict.m

# Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise

                          # (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

# =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
#  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.

# Load Training Data
print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...')
data = scipy.io.loadmat('data/ex3data1.mat')
X = data['X']
y = data['y']
m = len(X)

# ================ Part 2: Loading Pameters ================
# In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
# neural network parameters.

print('Loading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...')

# Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
weights = scipy.io.loadmat('data/ex3weights.mat')
Theta1 = weights['Theta1']
Theta2 = weights['Theta2']
# ================= Part 3: Implement Predict =================
#  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
#  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
#  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
#  you compute the training set accuracy.
